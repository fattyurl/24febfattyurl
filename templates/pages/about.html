    <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-600 space-y-4">
        <p>FattyURL was born out of frustration. When Bitly gutted their free plan, added interstitial ads to shortened links, and started charging $199/month for basic analytics, we knew there had to be a better way.</p>
        <p>We built FattyURL to be the URL shortener that Bitly used to be — simple, powerful, and actually free. Not "free with an asterisk," not "free trial," not "free but we'll show your visitors ads." Actually, genuinely, permanently free.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8">What We Believe</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Short links should be free.</strong> URL shortening is a utility, not a luxury product.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics should be included.</strong> Knowing who clicks your links shouldn't cost $199/month.</li>
            <li><strong>Links should never die.</strong> Your short links will work forever. Read our <a href="{% url 'promise_page' %}" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">promise</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy matters.</strong> We never store raw IP addresses and never sell your data.</li>
